== ABOUT LESLIE ==

Supported post formats: custom post type "custom_profile" and standard post only. Works perfectly in desktop browsers, tablets and handheld devices. For a live demo go to http://themes.tradesouthwest.com/leslie .

== NOTES ==

* Due to the multiple template layout variations of this theme some content areas will have very close margins when page is smaller. In order to create a wide compatibility of responsiveness between screen sizes theme is optimized to look its best on a wider screen and has some close margins with 1200px down to 1081px but is clean outside of those sizes.
